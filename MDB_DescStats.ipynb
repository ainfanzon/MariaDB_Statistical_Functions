    "# MariaDB AX ColumnStore: Built-In Statistical Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Business Intelligence (BI) and Data Science (DS) require processing huge amounts of data in various and complex ways using a vast array of statistical methods and tools. MariaDB AX lets you scale analytic workloads and analyze data in unforeseen ways without having to create query-optimized schemas and indexes. Furthermore, MariaDB AX ColumnStore interoperates with modern BI and DS tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "For data engineers, data analysts and data scientists, having an interactive computing environment that can drive exploration using notebooks (e.g., Jupyter) and structured query language (SQL) enables reliable iterative conversation between researcher and data. An example of MariaDB AX ColumnStore support for statistical functions within a Jupyter notebook is presented here.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## MariaDB AX ColumnStore\n",
    "\n",
    "MariaDB AX ColumnStore is a columnar database for modern, on-demand analytics. It uses distributed storage and massively parallel processing (MPP) to execute interactive, ad hoc queries on hundreds of terabytes of near-real-time data, with standard SQL and without creating indexes. MariaDB AX scales on commodity hardware, on premises or in the cloud, eliminating the need to spend budget on proprietary data warehouses and appliances.\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](./Columnar_Dist_Data_Storage.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Column oriented databases (a.k.a. columnar databases) are more suitable for analytical workloads because the data format lends itself to faster query processing. These database systems have been shown to perform more than an order of magnitude better than traditional row-oriented database systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Jupyter Notebook and MariaDB\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks success is it excels in a form of programming called __[“literate programming”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming/)__. Literate programming allows users to formulate and describe their thoughts with prose, supplemented by mathematical equations, as they prepare to write code blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MariaDB ColumnStore engine is extremely flexible. When you create a table on MariaDB ColumnStore, the system creates at least one file per column in the table. Thus, in a columnar storage format, the query touches only few columns and it is faster to load all values of a “particular column” into memory from disk in fewer Input/Output (I/O) operations and further into CPU cache in fewer instructions. Visit the MariaDB __[ColumnStore Storage Architecture](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/columnstore-storage-architecture/)__ page to get the details of the engine. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s see how all this fit together with an example. Start by creating a Jupyter notebook. The version of the notebook server in this example is: 5.6.0 using Python 3.7.0. The MariaDB AX Server version is 10.3.11 using the Columnstore engine version 1.2.2-1. \n",
    "\n",
    "The __pymsql__ module is used to connect from the Jupyter notebook to MariaDB. Import the module first, just as you would any other module. Then establish a database connection providing user credentials and server information. "

    "You have just got data with data about dog breeds. Each row describes one breed with attributes such as the height and weight of the breed in inches and pounds. Using basic statistics, you need to determine what is the __\"normal\"__ height and what is __\"extra large\"__ or __\"extra small\"__ dog breeds. For the purpose of this example an extra-large or extra-small breed is defined as one standard deviation from the average height mean. The code snippet below can be used to calculate the mean, variance and the \"Population Standard Deviation\"."

    "* Data discovery - Enable data engineers, data analysts and data scientists, to have an interactive computing environment that can drive exploration using notebooks (e.g., Jupyter) and structured query language (SQL).\n",
    "* Easy to maintain - Database Administrators love the fact that MariaDB AX Columnstore does not add complexity to the analytical and exploratory environment.\n",
    "* SQL front end - Data Scientist has been using SQL for their whole career.  No retraining is needed.\n",
